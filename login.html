        Vangaveeti Mohana Ranga Rao (4 July 1947 â€“ 26 December 1988) was an Indian politician from Andhra Pradesh.[1] He
        represented Vijayawada East assembly constituency as a member of Indian National Congress.

        Ranga's elder brother, Vangaveeti Radha Krishna Rao Sr., was associated with Chalasani Venkata Rathnam,
        secretary of the Communist Party of India, Vijayawada. However, conflicts arose between Venkata Rathnam and
        Vangaveeti Radha, to get a hold on Vijayawada transport business, dominated by Datti Kanaka Rao, a follower of
        Chalasani Venkata Rathnam. In 1972, both Kanaka Rao, and Venkata Rathnam were allegedly murdered by Vangaveeti
        Radha's supporters. These events in turn led to a retaliation by a rival group, ending in the murder of
        Vangaveeti Radha. Upon the death of Vangaveeti Radha, his brother Mohana Ranga took over the leadership of
        United independent Organization with the support of student union leaders Devineni Chandrasekhar (Gandhi), and
        Devineni Rajasekhar (Nehru).[2]

        The power struggle between the politically powerful Mohana Ranga and the Devineni family led to the splitting of
        the United Independent Organization and to the alleged protracted murders of brothers Devineni Chandrasekhar
        (Gandhi) in 1979 and Devineni Murali in 1988.[1][2] Subsequently, while Ranga was staging an indefinite fast for
        distribution of land pattas to residents of Giripuram, he was attacked by a group of men allegedly led by
        Devineni Rajasekhar (Nehru) and planned by N T Rama Rao, attacked Mohana Ranga's camp and assassinated him in
        the early hours of 26 December 1988. Ranga's two assigned bodyguards did not intervene.[3][4] The murder led to
        large-scale riots in erstwhile Krishna, Guntur and the Godavari districts.[3]
